# Business Interviews

Business interviews are important to identify what businesses building on Cardano
and looking to build on Cardano would need from the protocol to hit product market fit.

Below is an example interview workflow that can be used. It's important to adapt based on
the call, and not strictly go through the questions and end the call. Go where the discussion
leads you, but this provides a framework to get started.

If you are interested in doing business development interviews for the product committee,
please contact us. If you are a business that wants to provide input, we can also schedule
interviews if you contact us.

## Post-Interview Process

To make sure interviews are actionable and insights can be compared across companies, we recommend a **unified post-interview process**:

**Capture**  
- Record key answers using a standardized template.  
- Highlight notable quotes or insights that may inform protocol development.  

**Categorize**  
- Tag insights by theme (e.g., scalability, interoperability, regulation, adoption, customer trust).  
- Note differences between Web2 and Web3 contexts.  

**Summarize & Submit**  
- Write a 3–5 sentence summary highlighting the company’s main challenges, blockchain stance, and potential needs from Cardano.  
- Call out *actionable signals* that the product committee should consider.
