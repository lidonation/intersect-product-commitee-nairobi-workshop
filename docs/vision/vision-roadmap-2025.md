The 2025 roadmap comprises a number of items that have been
proposed by community members, as described below.
It is expected that progress will be made on most or all
of this roadmap. Importantly, the scope of the roadmap is not
fixed, but is open to new community contributions.

### Scaling the L1 Engine

L1 performance is crucial for widespread adoption and
enabling Cardano to become a central hub for blockchain
communication. This will be achieved through a combination
of codebase optimization and architectural enhancements
to increase parallelization.

#### Architectural Excellence

Cardano is committed to maintaining its position at the forefront of blockchain
technology. This includes a continuous evaluation of software architecture best
practices. We recognize the evolving landscape of architectural patterns and
are dedicated to exploring and implementing the most suitable approaches for
Cardano's unique needs including operating the world’s most reliable and
globally decentralised blockchain.

* **Modular Design:**  We will prioritize a modular design approach for
Cardano's codebase, enabling independent development and deployment of
components while maintaining a cohesive and efficient system that meets the
timing, security and reliability requirements that are fundamental to Cardano.
This allows for flexibility and adaptability as the platform evolves.

* **Performance Optimization:**  We will continuously analyze and optimize the
performance of Cardano's architecture, exploring and evaluating different
architectural patterns to ensure maximum efficiency and scalability focusing on
the worst-case behaviours that govern overall system behaviour, rather than
deceptive average-case behaviours. This includes investigating and benchmarking
promising alternatives to established patterns to determine the most suitable
approach for various Cardano components.

* **Formal Methods and Verification:**  Security and reliability are paramount
for blockchain systems. We will leverage formal methods and verification
techniques to rigorously specify and analyze critical components of Cardano's
architecture including timeliness and worst-case behaviours. This will enable
us to mathematically prove the correctness of these components and minimize the
risk of vulnerabilities. We will continue to invest in research and development
in formal methods to enhance their applicability and effectiveness in the
context of Cardano.

* **Research and Exploration:** We will dedicate resources to research and
explore cutting-edge architectural patterns and technologies, ensuring that
Cardano remains at the forefront of technical excellence and can adapt to the
ever-changing blockchain landscape. This will involve close monitoring of
industry trends and collaboration with experts in software architecture
especially for complex real-time distributed systems.

#### Leios

Leios is a groundbreaking innovation designed to
significantly enhance Cardano's scalability and
transaction throughput. It introduces a novel approach
to block creation, moving away from the traditional
sequential model.

* Leios leverages a parallel block
  creation process. Instead of a single linear chain
  of blocks, it introduces multiple "input blocks"
  that are independently created and endorsed by
  Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). These endorsements
  are then aggregated into "endorsement blocks,"
  and finally, a "ranking block" determines the final
  order and validity of transactions across all input
  blocks.
* This parallel approach has the
  potential to dramatically increase transaction
  throughput while maintaining the security and
  decentralization of the Cardano blockchain.

The roadmap for 2025 includes several key steps to achieve
in preparation for the development and implementation of Leios:

  * Develop formal specifications to guide node
    implementations and ensure correctness.
  * Conduct extensive simulations to validate
    the theoretical design of Leios in real-world
    network conditions and identify optimal parameters.
  * Refactor the Cardano node to facilitate
    the integration of Leios and ensure smooth
    and efficient operation.


#### Optimizations

* Optimize the current codebase and address technical debt to
  improve performance. This will enable more flexible parameter
  adjustments by the parameter committee, allowing for increased
  scalability without requiring a hard fork.

* Enhance Mithril's decentralization by integrating
  it more closely with the node and utilizing
  existing networking layers.

#### Anti-grinding

* Introduce measures to mitigate CPU-based grinding
  attacks, improving settlement speed and network security.

#### LSM Integration

* Reduce memory requirements for nodes by integrating
  Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees, initially
  focusing on the UTxO set.

### Incoming Liquidity

Increasing liquidity from other ecosystems is vital
  for expanding Cardano's user base.

* Utilize zero-knowledge proofs to enable Cardano
  to serve as a decentralized DeFi layer for Bitcoin.
* Babel Fees (Nested Transactions) facilitate
  transactions on the L1 for users without initial
  ADA holdings through a decentralized marketplace
  that allows partial transactions to be accepted
  and combined from multiple parties, where a
  marketplace can arbitrage the value in ADA for a
  user to get ADA to spend the transaction and
  have the minimum ADA required without having
  to purchase ADA first through an exchange.

### L2 Expansion

To accommodate increasing transaction volume, Cardano will focus on expanding
the capabilities of L2 solutions.

#### Actively Validated Services (AVS) Layer for Partner Chains

This framework outlines a method for creating independent, customizable
blockchain networks (partner chains) leveraging a robust and secure underlying
value *validation* layer.  This approach allows for greater flexibility and
experimentation while benefiting from the security and reliability of the
Ouroboros Proof Of Stake consensus mechanism on Cardano. This framework is
designed to facilitate seamless value transfer between partner chains, forming
the basis of a decentralized open standard.

Key benefits include customizable partner chain parameters, prototyping of new
features without impacting AVS stability, inheritance of AVS security, and
increased partner chain scalability. The technical approach involves extending
existing consensus mechanisms to operate in multiple modes, such as adding a
FastBFT mode. This includes creating a slimmed-down version of core blockchain
components and developing standardized messaging and transaction formats for
inter-chain communication.

Use cases include customized partner chains for dApps, testing new technologies
on partner chains, and private partner chains for consortiums.

Future development will focus on integrating multiple consensus sources,
enabling seamless cross-chain communication, defining a clear protocol for
inter-chain transactions, developing a standardized interface for AVS
interaction, and establishing community governance.

#### Hydra

Explore new use cases for Hydra, such as governance
tools, and continue to enhance its scalability
and performance.

* Build upon the success of Hydra Doom by identifying
  and developing further use cases that can leverage
  Hydra's scalability to benefit the Cardano ecosystem.

* Explore the use of Hydra as a platform for decentralized
  governance discussions and voting, addressing
  the challenges of managing large volumes of
  information on the L1.

#### Midgard

Midgard is Cardano’s first optimistic rollup framework,
leveraging the EUTxO model to achieve permissionless
operation, efficient fraud proofs, and censorship
resistance, without relying on centralized sequencers
or custodial multisigs. This unique design enables
high-throughput, low-fee transactions while maintaining
Cardano's robust security and decentralization.
By aggregating off-chain transactions into compact
representations on-chain, Midgard ensures that
increased activity directly benefits Cardano’s L1,
enabling a sustainable and innovative ecosystem
for decentralized applications.

#### Finality (Peras)

Peras is an enhancement to the Ouroboros Praos protocol that aims
to accelerate transaction settlement times. In the current Praos protocol,
new blocks are added probabilistically, and the longest chain of blocks is
generally considered the valid one. Peras introduces a novel approach
by incorporating a voting mechanism among Stake Pool Operators (SPOs).

SPOs can vote to endorse specific blocks, effectively increasing their weight
within the chain. This "voting" mechanism allows for a faster consensus on the
most valid chain, leading to quicker transaction finality. Faster transaction
finality can significantly improve the user experience and enable
more efficient and timely transactions.

### Developer/User Experience

Improving developer and user experience is crucial
for driving broader adoption.

* Generate libraries in various languages to
  simplify blockchain interaction for developers.
* Expand RPC capabilities to support queries
  and transaction building, enabling seamless
  integration with node services.
* Empower developers to create custom chain
  indexers for specific needs, such as supporting
  partner chains. Creating a translation layer
  of blocks and ledger events to a Nats Core
  pub/sub messaging system can be used as an
  example indexer framework.
* Decentralize data API services to reduce
  reliance on centralized providers and empower
  SPOs.
* Promote the use of local nodes and develop
  standards for wallet interaction with full nodes.
* Establish a unified standard for tracing,
  logging, and monitoring across different
  node implementations.

### Programmable Assets

Expanding the capabilities of programmable
  assets will unlock new possibilities for
  decentralized applications.

Enhancing Cardano's programmable asset capabilities is crucial for
unlocking the full potential of dApps. They expand on-chain asset
functionality beyond simple transfers, enabling complex,
programmable logic. These advancements will empower developers to
build innovative dApps, exploring use cases like soul-bound tokens,
or tokens that can never be transacted to another wallet,
for decentralized identity, mechanisms for custodian regulated
stablecoins, and royalty mechanisms to support creators.

* Develop frameworks that enable a new class
  of programmable assets beyond native tokens.
* UTxO intent signatures enhance decentralized exchange
  interactions by allowing users to signify their intent
  to spend UTxOs under specific conditions, facilitating
  swaps while maintaining user ownership of their funds.
* Explore the use of soul-bound tokens for
  decentralized identity and other applications.
* Implement royalty mechanisms to support
  creators and incentivize innovation.
* Enable the issuance of custodian regulated stablecoins
  on Cardano through policy-based mechanisms, such as USDC/USDT.

### Multiple Node Implementations

The development and maintenance of multiple node implementations are
absolutely crucial for Cardano's resilience and censorship resistance;
however only if they adhere to a properly implemented and secure specification.
This diversity strengthens security through a form of distributed peer
review, as different teams scrutinize each codebase, increasing the
likelihood of identifying and addressing potential flaws before they
can be exploited. Furthermore, diverse implementations decentralize the
development process itself, reducing the risk associated with relying
on a single entity. This distributed development model fosters a more
robust and adaptable ecosystem, as different teams bring unique
perspectives and approaches to the ongoing evolution of the Cardano
network Ultimately, the more high-quality, independent node
implementations we have, the stronger, censorship resistant and more decentralized
Cardano becomes, ensuring its long-term viability and success.

Ensuring node conformity in Cardano relies heavily on rigorous formal
specifications. These specifications serve as the definitive
guide for node implementation, detailing the precise behavior and
functionality expected of every compliant node. They enable property tests to be
automatically extracted, enabling node implementations to demonstrate full
conformance to the specifications. By adhering to these meticulously crafted
specifications, node developers can create implementations that are interoperable
and compatible with the broader Cardano network. By providing concrete, actionable
instructions and guidelines for building and configuring nodes, ensuring
consistency and adherence to the established standards. This combination of
precise specifications is essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of
the Cardano network, guaranteeing that all participating nodes operate
according to the agreed-upon rules and protocols.

### SPO Incentive Improvements

The community has identified incentives can be improved for stake
pool operators. This is a few suggestions of what can be assessed.

* Introduce min-margin parameter that can be voted on via governance to modify
* Modify pledge-benefit curve for a0 and k
* Address Delegation Mobility
* Explore distributing the full rewards pot for active stake in the rewards calculation
* Consider rewards for Mithril signers, block rewards for different Leios block types, and rewards for Testnet SPOs

**Note:** This vision and  roadmap represents a high-level overview
and will be further refined and iterated upon based
on ongoing research, community feedback, and
technological advancements. It is based on the results of the TSC survey.
The initial author of this roadmap is Sam Leathers, Chair for
the Intersect Product Committee.
