# Connecting with the Community in Nairobi - September 2025

## Introduction

In September 2025, the Cardanians in the Nairobi, Kenya area added 
their voices to the global conversation focusing on Cardano's 2030 
Community Vision. Organized and presented by the Cardano Hub NBO, 
this workshop aimed to deepen engagement with the East African 
Cardano ecosystem and understand regional priorities for 
blockchain adoption. This document shares key insights and learnings 
from this important initiative.

## The Workshop

Held in Nairobi, at the Blockchain Centre NBO, a community learning center 
by Wada & 2 Lovelaces, the workshop brought together community members,
developers, potential DReps, and blockchain enthusiasts to explore
Cardano's strategic direction toward 2030. Participants engaged in
group readings and presentation of the current draft, followed by 
comprehensive Q&A sessions and feedback collection using mentimeter. 
Using metimeter allowed everyone to provide feedback directly using 
their mobile devices. Goals included aligning Cardano's development
with African community needs, encouraging governance participation, and
identifying real-world blockchain applications for the region.
